# Mid-Side Utility Plugin

## What does the plugin do?

The Mid-Side Utility Plugin is a very effective tool for mixing and mastering. The Mid channel is the center of a stereo image. When the Mids are boosted, the listener perceives centred audio (anything not panned). The Side channel is the edges of a stereo image. When the sides are boosted, the listener percieves an exageratted stereo width (anything panned). The plugins features are listed below:

 - Input Selection (Combo Box)
 - Output Selection (Combo Box)
 - Stereo Width Blend (Slider 0-2)
 - Stereo Width Modulation Activation (Toggle Button)
 - Stereo Width Modulation Rate (Slider 0-20,000)
 - Stereo Width Modulation Amount (Slider 0-1)
 - Polarity Inversion Left Channel (Toggle Button)
 - Polarity Inversion Right Channel (Toggle Button)

## Why is this plugin useful?

This plugin can be enlightening when eliminating the mids of a track for, example it could highlight processed effects that were not as prominant in the full mix. Another useful example could be to make it easier isolating vocals when eliminating the sides.  This plugin serves as an easier way to exagerate the stereo width without using an EQ to boost side frequencies.  

## How can users get started with the plugin?

To get started, the 4 source files, the MSUtility.jucer file and the additional Maximillian files must be cloned to the users computer or laptop from the GitHub repository. Once cloned the MSUtility.jucer file will allow the plugin to be saved and opened into the users preffered IDE.  For example, Xcode. In the IDE the plugin can be built, which generates a VST3 file from the .jucer project due to pre defined selections by the plugins programer. The VST3 file should be directed to a save location that the users preffered digital audio workstation (DAW) can see the file. From the DAW the plugin can be used.  

## Where can users get help with the plugin?
